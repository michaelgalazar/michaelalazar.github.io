<body>
    After I graduated from college back in 2010, I was assigned as a high-school teacher to do community service. Even though my degree was in Civil engineering, it is the government who decide where to do my service. I was only 23 years old with no previous experience to teach. My first teaching experience taught me a lot about being an educator and about myself. Even though the learning content (which was Physics) was not troublesome, coming up with four weeks' worth of lesson plans, correcting assignments, and making sure that everyone got the required lesson was something that I had never done before. But through time I started to master all the teaching strategies and got enough confidence to deal with all the issues that required from a good teacher. By the end of the term, I was awarded a medal as the best teacher of the year.
    On the next year there came a circumstance where administration obligation added to my life. Our head of department felt sick and the school was discovering someone who can make up for his position. One day the director of the school gave me a letter that I would be the head of the department. At first, it was amazingly hard for me to sort out what I ought to do each day. It was great experience for me to lead 17 instructors having a preferable experience than mine. But, with time, the interaction got somewhat simpler, and I began getting more innovative with driving the group just as the exercise plans. I additionally figured out how to make a timetable of what will be done and at what time. Presumably, the most important exercise I had learned is not to be reluctant to 'act' like the top of the division. 
    Your partners are experts, they will not be outraged if a few things are guidelines. I have likewise needed to advise myself that when I have decided not to give a guidance, and rather have made a solicitation and not be irritated if individuals decide not to do what I have inquired. Possibly make things discretionary if individuals quitting is worthy to you. I was additionally involved in the local, provincial, and national advocacy groups pointed toward improving education and social conditions.  
    To be a leader in school or college is not an easy task. It is not about how much profit you can make, instead, it is what type of ideas and knowledge you are building on the mind of students and the community. Most of the time teachers just think about how they can cover the topic and finish the course. But department heads are those leaders who shall take responsibility for how smooth the teaching and learning process is going thereby the future of the nation as well as the world should be.
